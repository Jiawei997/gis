abstract = {Henri B{\'{e}}nard, a French physicist working at the beginning of the 20th century, found the following about a liquid in a round vessel heated from below: At the beginning of the process, when the temperature difference between the heated bottom and the cool top is low, the heat is being transferred by conduction and no macro-motion can be observed in the liquid. However, as the temperature difference increases and a certain threshold is reached, the movement in the liquid becomes instable, chaotic and then a strikingly ordered pattern appears: The molecules of the liquid which at the beginning were moving in random, suddenly exhibit a coherent macro-movement in roles which are millions of times larger than the molecules. As can be seen in Fig. 4.1, the motion of the roles forms a hexagonal pattern on the surface of the liquid. This pattern is in fact an outcome of the movement of the hot liquid, which rises through the center of the honeycomb cells, and of the cooler liquid, which falls along their walls. All this happens as if by an external force. Yet no such force exists – the spatial order appears spontaneously, by means of self-organization.},

@article{Simmel1950,
abstract = {Terms followed by numbers in {\{}{\}} are defined at the bottom of the essay The deepest problems of modern life derive from the claim of the individual to preserve the autonomy and individuality of his existence in the face of overwhelming social forces, of historical heritage, of external culture, and of the technique of life. The fight with nature which primitive man has to wage for his bodily existence attains in this modern form its latest transformation. The eighteenth century called upon man to free himself of all the historical bonds in the state and in religion, in morals and in economics. Man's nature, originally good and common to all, should develop unhampered. In addition to more liberty, the nineteenth century demanded the functional specialization {\{}1{\}} of man and his work; this specialization makes one individual incomparable to another, and each of them indispensable to the highest possible extent. However, this specialization makes each man the more directly dependent upon the supplementary activities of all others. Nietzsche sees the full development of the individual conditioned by the most ruthless struggle of individuals; socialism believes in the suppression of all competition for the same reason. Be that as it may, in all these positions the same basic motive is at work: the person resists to being leveled down and worn out by a social-technological mechanism. An inquiry into the inner meaning of specifically modern life and its products, into the soul {\{}2{\}} of the cultural body, so to speak, must seek to solve the equation which structures like the metropolis set up between the individual and the super-individual contents of life {\{}3{\}}. Such an inquiry must answer the question of how the personality accommodates itself in the adjustments to external forces. This will be my task today. The psychological basis of the metropolitan type of individuality consists in the intensification of nervous stimulation which results from the swift and uninterrupted change of outer and inner stimuli. Man is a differentiating creature. His mind is stimulated by the difference between a momentary impression and the one which preceded it. Lasting impressions, {\{}4{\}} impressions which differ only slightly from one another, impressions which take a regular and habitual course and show regular and habitual contrasts-all these use up, so to speak, less consciousness than does the rapid crowding of changing images, the sharp discontinuity in the grasp of a single glance, and the unexpectedness of onrushing impressions. These are the psychological conditions which the metropolis creates. With each crossing of the street, with the tempo and multiplicity of economic, occupational and social life, the city sets up a deep contrast with small town and rural life with reference to the sensory foundations of psychic life. The metropolis exacts from man as a discriminating creature a different amount of consciousness than does rural life. Here the rhythm of life and sensory mental imagery flows more slowly, more habitually, and more evenly. Precisely in this connection the sophisticated character of metropolitan psychic life becomes understandable -as over against small town life which rests more upon deeply felt and emotional relationships. These latter are rooted in the more unconscious layers of the psyche {\{}5{\}} and grow most readily in the steady rhythm of uninterrupted habituations. The intellect {\{}6{\}}, however, has its locus in the transparent, conscious, higher layers of the psyche; it is the most adaptable of our inner forces. In order to accommodate to change and to the contrast of phenomena, the intellect does not require any shocks and inner upheavals; it is only through such upheavals that the more conservative mind could accommodate to the metropolitan rhythm of events. Thus the metropolitan type of man-which, of course, exists in a thousand individual variants -develops an organ protecting him against the threatening currents and discrepancies of his external environment which would uproot him. He reacts with his head instead of his heart. In this an increased awareness assumes the psychic prerogative. Metropolitan life, thus, underlies a heightened awareness and a predominance of intelligence in metropolitan man. The reaction to metropolitan phenomena is shifted to that organ which is least sensitive and quite remote},

abstract = {GRNUHE´s focus is on evidence for action on the social determinants of health, particularly in low and middle income countries. GRNUHE follows on from the work of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health which stated that communities, neighbourhoods and cities that ensure access to basic goods, that are socially cohesive, that are designed to promote good physical and psychological well-being and that are protective of the natural environment are essential for health equity. The network is convened by Dr Sharon Friel, and comprises Professor Sir Michael Marmot of University College London, researchers predominantly from low and middle income countries, but also includes key urban health researchers in high income countries, urban planners, non-government organisations and international development agencies. GRNUHE will meet three times during the course of 2009/2010 to review the current knowledge in urban health, set direction for a global research agenda and develop concrete collaborative research projects in low and middle income countries. Specifically, the aims of GRNUHE are fivefold: provide an opportunity to utilise the existing global evidence in countries too often under-resourced in terms of evidence and capacity; develop both a suitable intellectual framework and a methodological approach to undertake urban health equity research in low and middle income countries; support the necessary expansion of evidence in key areas relevant to the emerging health and social issues in contextually different corners of the world; provide global leadership in urban health equity that combines research, training and policy expertise within a multisectoral, interdisciplinary collaborative framework; develop a practical suite of collaborative action-oriented research projects in urban health equity.},

abstract = {Many solutions to the problems confronting cities involve the integration of systems of systems. The complexity of integrating diverse systems requires approaches that are adaptive and collaborative. This paper argues that these approaches can valuably draw on a range of emerging technologies, such as virtual representations, using the massive increase in available data from ubiquitous instrumentation. It contends that the interrelations in cities between different systems can be better explored, and decisions improved, through using this technology. A brief case study of some elements of IBM's Smarter Cities strategy, based on instrumentation, interconnection, and intelligence is presented. The company's Emergency Response System in Rio de Janeiro is provided as an example of the role technology can play in developing an integrated system of systems. This exploratory paper concludes that the new innovation technologies can contribute to effective approaches for dealing with emerging challenges in cities. {\textcopyright} 2011 Copyright The Society of Urban Technology.},

It follows the spontaneous emergence of abstract planning codes and principles, influenced by changing social, political and cultural dynamics. Based on a morphological analysis of 77 towns in northern and central Israel, and an in-depth investigation conducted in the city of Sakhnin, in the central Galilee, the paper reveals a repeated three-ring structure, corresponding to three socio-political periods. We offer a detailed examination of the links between social values and spatial conduct, thus enabling us to follow how slight changes in social and economic circumstances affect planning principles. In addition, the paper highlights the power of planning-without-a-plan as a method that facilitates shaping the quality of the built environment while allowing local adaptation and creativity. Finally, we discuss the problematic urban pattern created in the typical third ring, which is a top-to-bottom product of modern planning thought.},

abstract = {Analysis of changing patterns of ethnic residential segregation is usually framed by the coarse categorisations of ethnicity used in censuses and other large-scale public sector surveys and by the infrequent time intervals at which such surveys are conducted. In this paper, we use names-based classification of Consumer Registers to investigate changing degrees of segregation in England and Wales over the period 1997–2016 at annual resolution. We find that names-based ethnic classification of the individuals that make up Consumer Registers provides reliable estimates of the residential patterning of different ethnic groups and the degree to which they are segregated. Building upon this finding, we explore more detailed segregation patterns and trends of finer groups at annual resolutions and discover some unexpected trends that have hitherto remained unrecorded by Census-based studies. We conclude that appropriately processed Consumer Registers hold considerable potential to contribute to various domains of urban geography and policy.},

@article{Leon2011,
abstract = {Information and communications technology (ICT) is being exploited within cities to enable them to better compete in a global knowledge-based service-led economy. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, cities exploited large technical systems (LTSs)-such as the telegraph, telephony, electrical networks, and other technologies-to enhance their social and economic position. This paper examines how the LTS model applies to ICT deployments, including broadband network, municipal wireless, and related services, and how cities and city planners in the twenty-first century are using or planning to use these technologies. This paper also examines their motivations and expectations, the contribution to date, and the factors affecting outcomes. The findings extend the LTS model by proposing an increased role for organizations with respect to an individual agency. The findings show how organizations form themselves into networks that interact and influence the outcome of the system at the level of the city. The extension to LTS, in the context of city infrastructure, is referred to as the complex city system framework. This proposed framework integrates the role of these stakeholder networks, as well as that of the socioeconomic, technical, and spatial factors within a city, and shows how together they shape the technical system and its socioeconomic contribution. {\textcopyright} 2011 by International Business Machines Corporation.},

However, existing research mainly presents the urban population living with this diversity as one group with the same overall perception of diversity. The purpose of this article is to nuance the concept of diversity through analysing the differences in urban residents' perceptions of neighbourhood diversity and the factors shaping these perceptions. The article is based on 50 qualitative interviews with residents of Bispebjerg, one of the most diverse neighbourhoods of Copenhagen, Denmark. The overall finding is that living with diversity is a diverse experience. The article identifies five ideal types of residents to demonstrate how perceptions of diversity are being shaped. They all express a positive perception of diversity on an abstract level but voice concerns regarding concrete aspects of diversity. The article identifies key factors shaping these concrete perceptions of diversity: insecurity towards ethnic diversity; social inequality; degree of socialisation to diversity; and physical and social detachment from diversity. The findings point to the importance of acknowledging differences between perceptions of diversity for different groups of residents and of addressing the different concerns of these groups.},

abstract = {This article engages with the current research and debate about the creative city and the importance of cultural infrastructure in contemporary cities. It argues that much of the focus has been around the investment of cities in specific regeneration projects or flagship developments rather than addressing the nature of the infrastructure, networks and agents engaging in the city's cultural development. The complexity theory and its associated principles can provide a new understanding of the connection between the urban space and the systems of local cultural production and consumption. Drawing on interviews with creative practitioners in the North East region of England, the paper argues that the cultural development of a city is a complex adaptive system. This finding has implications for both policy-makers and academic research. It emphasises the importance of micro interactions and networks between creative practitioners, the publicly supported cultural sector and the cultural infrastructure of the city. {\textcopyright} 2010 Urban Studies Journal Limited.},

abstract = {It is well known by now that half of humanity lives in urban areas and the proportion is growing. Cities, with their concentration of culture, infrastructure, and institutions have long driven the progress of civilization and have been the focus of opportunity and prosperity. For both rich and poor, in developed and developing countries, cities offer unique opportunities for residents to increase income, to mobilize for political action, and to benefit from education as well as health and social services. These positive aspects of city life remain magnets for people to come to and stay in urban areas.},

@article{Batty2008a,
abstract = {Despite a century of effort, our understanding of how cities evolve is still woefully inadequate. Recent research, however, suggests that cities are complex systems that mainly grow from the bottom up, their size and shape following well-defined scaling laws that result from intense competition for space. An integrated theory of how cities evolve, linking urban economics and transportation behavior to developments in network science, allometric growth, and fractal geometry, is being slowly developed. This science provides new insights into the resource limits facing cities in terms of the meaning of density, compactness, and sprawl, and related questions of sustainability. It has the potential to enrich current approaches to city planning and replace traditional top-down strategies with realistic city plans that benefit all city dwellers.},
